# turntable-wifi-esp32

First of all: this is a remake of the amazing: https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4817279

I made the following changes:

the table now is bigger : 28 cm of diameter
I used an ESP32 with WIFI
I made it an Access Point
you can access via AP and change: direction and speed
the switch is round
it is all fully enclosed with 18650 batteries that can be extracted and changes
I know it is overkill using esp32, but it was there around doing nothing. the ESP has also a display which I am not using.

You can find also the *.ino file and the html.h one.
I am not very good in HTML5 and css so if you can get it better let me know that I will update it.

Notes:
You need a large plate for printing the top which is 28 cm of diameter.
at the same time it is important to have a flexible plate otherwise it will be very difficult to take it out given the large surface that touches the bed.
I suggest 4 perimeters, using for the external one 95% flow and lower speed, in this way you have an amazing smooth result.
